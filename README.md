## Boilerplate for a React / Redux e-commerce PWA.

### Initialize your project

Now run the following commands in your terminal

**NOTE: You only need to run this once!**

```sh
$ npm install # This will install the necessary packages to use the app
```

**That's it!**


### To run the app in Development Mode

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Wait about 30 seconds for your development environment to initialize.

When it finishes, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`

If you see the landing page, it means you have set up everything successfully.

### List of NPM Commands

```sh
$ npm run dev       # build and watch, but javascript not minified
$ npm run build     # build a minified production version
$ npm run build:s3  # build a minified production version, deploy it to S3 as a static app
$ npm run lint      # linting using ESLint
$ npm run test      # run test using Jest
$ npm run clean     # it runs before each build, so you don't need to
```
